# üîî Hey, It Is Your Random Reminder!

------------
### THE KEY IDEA
Struggling to stay on track? Traditional reminders often fail because we tune out repetitive alerts ‚Äî they become background noise. This project tackles procrastination with a smarter approach: randomized, surprise reminders that you can't ignore.

By leveraging unpredictability, these reminders catch you off guard, jolting you out of autopilot and forcing you to reassess your choices in the moment. Unlike scheduled notifications, you won't mentally "schedule around" them ‚Äî they could appear anytime, keeping your brain engaged and your goals front-of-mind.

**Why it should work:**
- **Surprise > Routine:** Random timing prevents habituation, making each reminder feel novel.
- **Focus on Intentionality:** Forces you to pause and ask, "Am I acting in line with my goals right now?"
- **Long-Term Consistency:** Over time, these micro-check-ins build accountability without burnout.

Whether you're avoiding tasks, drifting into distractions, or making short-term choices that sabotage long-term goals, this system acts like a "guardrail" for your focus ‚Äî keeping you aligned even when willpower falters.

### WHY macOS C++ COMMAND LINE APP?
This project‚Äôs technical choices reflect a focus on learning fundamentals while solving real-world problems:

- **C++ for Foundation Building:** As a newcomer to software development, I wanted to prioritize mastering core concepts of standard library before relying on frameworks like Qt or ImGui. C++ forces deliberate thinking, which accelerates growth.
- **CLI for Simplicity and Focus:** Command-line interfaces strip away GUI complexities, letting me hone algorithmic logic, file I/O, and system interactions ‚Äî skills that transfer to any future project. Plus, it avoids distractions I'm still learning.
- **macOS for Built-In Tools:** The macOS `say` command provides instant text-to-speech functionality without external libraries. This avoids the overhead of integrating third-party packages, letting me focus on the core problem: designing effective reminders.
